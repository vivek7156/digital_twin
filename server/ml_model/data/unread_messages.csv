I am informing you the fact well in advance, so that no complaints at the end will be entertained.

So, all the students should contact to all your teachers of theory and practical from now onwards to get the assignments.

Subject: Low Attendance & Poor Performance in Unit Test-1 (Engineering Mathematics-III) 
 
Dear Students of SE Computer Div-A & Div-B,
It has been observed that the attendance in Unit Test-1 of Engineering Mathematics-III was very low. Only 50 out of 62 students from Div-A and 27 out of 62 students from Div-B attended the test. This is not acceptable, as regular participation in tests is important for your academic progress.
Also, the overall performance in the test is not satisfactory. I advise all students to take their studies seriously and work on improving their understanding of the subject.
Students who appeared for the test are requested to visit my cabin to check their answer sheets and marks obtained in Unit Test-1.
I hope to see better participation and performance in the next tests.
Best regards,
[Mr. Sachin Gaikwad]

Subject: Academic Feedback 2024-25 SEM II Mid SEM 
 
Dear Student:
Effective feedback is designed to determine a learner's level of understanding and skill development to plan the next steps towards achieving the learning intentions or goals.

*	Kindly keep the following points in Mind before Completing All the Feedbacks...

1.	Anonymity: Your course evaluations are completely anonymous, both the numerical results and written comments. Your responses are not linked to your ID number. Note that this is why each evaluation must be completed in one sitting.
2.	Confidentiality: The complete results are confidential to the instructor, HoD, Principal and Director.
3.	Be respectful: Derogatory comments or criticisms based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc. are not appropriate in course evaluations.
4.	The instructor cannot see the results until the final grades for the course have been submitted and processed.
5.	When you are providing feedback, you will be comparing the instructor to other instructors, either consciously or unconsciously. When you are comparing, remember that the comparison group should be other professors and courses at the Institute, not teachers and courses at high school.

*	Considerations when Writing Comments

1.	Constructive feedback from students is a valuable resource for improving teaching. The feedback should be specific, focused, and respectful. It should also address aspects of the course and teaching that are positive as well as those which need improvement.
2.	Be specific and provide examples when commenting on the course or the instructor. Speak based on your own experiences, not on behalf of your classmates.
3.	Focus on observable behaviors of the instructor or on specific aspects of the course. Describe the situation you are commenting on.

The Feedback is on ERP(https://erp.aitpune.edu.in:8006/), Login and go to forms‚Üí Academic Feedback‚Üí select Academic Feedback 2024-25 SEM II MID-SEM.

Dear Student:
Effective feedback is designed to determine a learner's level of understanding and skill development to plan the next steps towards achieving the learning intentions or goals.

*	Kindly keep the following points in Mind before Completing All the Feedbacks...

1.	Anonymity: Your course evaluations are completely anonymous, both the numerical results and written comments. Your responses are not linked to your ID number. Note that this is why each evaluation must be completed in one sitting.
2.	Confidentiality: The complete results are confidential to the instructor, HoD, Principal and Director.
3.	Be respectful: Derogatory comments or criticisms based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc. are not appropriate in course evaluations.
4.	The instructor cannot see the results until the final grades for the course have been submitted and processed.
5.	When you are providing feedback, you will be comparing the instructor to other instructors, either consciously or unconsciously. When you are comparing, remember that the comparison group should be other professors and courses at the Institute, not teachers and courses at high school.

*	Considerations when Writing Comments

1.	Constructive feedback from students is a valuable resource for improving teaching. The feedback should be specific, focused, and respectful. It should also address aspects of the course and teaching that are positive as well as those which need improvement.
2.	Be specific and provide examples when commenting on the course or the instructor. Speak based on your own experiences, not on behalf of your classmates.
3.	Focus on observable behaviors of the instructor or on specific aspects of the course. Describe the situation you are commenting on.

Subject: Academic Feedback 2024-25 SEM II Mid SEM 
 
Dear Student:
Effective feedback is designed to determine a learner's level of understanding and skill development to plan the next steps towards achieving the learning intentions or goals.

*	Kindly keep the following points in Mind before Completing All the Feedbacks...

1.	Anonymity: Your course evaluations are completely anonymous, both the numerical results and written comments. Your responses are not linked to your ID number. Note that this is why each evaluation must be completed in one sitting.
2.	Confidentiality: The complete results are confidential to the instructor, HoD, Principal and Director.
3.	Be respectful: Derogatory comments or criticisms based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc. are not appropriate in course evaluations.
4.	The instructor cannot see the results until the final grades for the course have been submitted and processed.
5.	When you are providing feedback, you will be comparing the instructor to other instructors, either consciously or unconsciously. When you are comparing, remember that the comparison group should be other professors and courses at the Institute, not teachers and courses at high school.

*	Considerations when Writing Comments

1.	Constructive feedback from students is a valuable resource for improving teaching. The feedback should be specific, focused, and respectful. It should also address aspects of the course and teaching that are positive as well as those which need improvement.
2.	Be specific and provide examples when commenting on the course or the instructor. Speak based on your own experiences, not on behalf of your classmates.
3.	Focus on observable behaviors of the instructor or on specific aspects of the course. Describe the situation you are commenting on.

The Feedback is on ERP(https://erp.aitpune.edu.in:8006/), Login and go to forms‚Üí Academic Feedback‚Üí select Academic Feedback 2024-25 SEM II MID-SEM.

Dear students
                                    
Read the circular carefully before applying for revaluation. 

If you apply for photocopy verification, then you need to submit a hardcopy of the form with relevant documents within 2  days (after receiving photocopy) to the exam section of college. After that only the exam section can proceed with your form in the remaining three to four days to university.  

Within five days your hardcopy should reach university otherwise university will not consider your case.(Stated in circular).
Submission of hardcopy to exam cell is important then and then only after verification college will approve your application and it will be available to university .

If you don't follow the timelines, then your case will not be considered by the university.


*Photocopy verification and Revaluation both are different.
For revaluation you can apply directly to university in that college involvement will not be there

41,Academic Feedback 2024-25 SEM II Mid SEM,2025-02-27 10:15:07,Priyanka Holkar,"Dear Student:
Effective feedback is designed to determine a learner's level of understanding and skill development to plan the next steps towards achieving the learning intentions or goals.

*	Kindly keep the following points in Mind before Completing All the Feedbacks...

1.	Anonymity: Your course evaluations are completely anonymous, both the numerical results and written comments. Your responses are not linked to your ID number. Note that this is why each evaluation must be completed in one sitting.
2.	Confidentiality: The complete results are confidential to the instructor, HoD, Principal and Director.
3.	Be respectful: Derogatory comments or criticisms based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc. are not appropriate in course evaluations.
4.	The instructor cannot see the results until the final grades for the course have been submitted and processed.
5.	When you are providing feedback, you will be comparing the instructor to other instructors, either consciously or unconsciously. When you are comparing, remember that the comparison group should be other professors and courses at the Institute, not teachers and courses at high school.

*	Considerations when Writing Comments

1.	Constructive feedback from students is a valuable resource for improving teaching. The feedback should be specific, focused, and respectful. It should also address aspects of the course and teaching that are positive as well as those which need improvement.
2.	Be specific and provide examples when commenting on the course or the instructor. Speak based on your own experiences, not on behalf of your classmates.
3.	Focus on observable behaviors of the instructor or on specific aspects of the course. Describe the situation you are commenting on.

Dear Sir/Ma'am,
I hope you are doing well!

The IEEE-IISc VLSI Student Branch Chapter is pleased to invite you to a webinar on ""Merging Insights from Artificial and Biological Neural Networks for Neuromorphic Edge Intelligence"" by Charlotte Frenkel <https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=Lf6_Zl0AAAAJ&hl=fr> , from Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands. 
 
The event details are mentioned below:
Event Timing: 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM (IST)
Event Date: 19th February, 2025
Event Mode: Online (MS Teams)
Event Registration Link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWTxXIiRgKMlX8bbK00vMU5-K2l4ib8ykCa3e0Tvw5TCqkzA/viewform?usp=dialog <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScWTxXIiRgKMlX8bbK00vMU5-K2l4ib8ykCa3e0Tvw5TCqkzA/viewform?usp=dialog> 



Please find below the abstract for the talk and the speaker's bio:

Abstract:
The development of efficient bio-inspired training algorithms and adaptive hardware is currently missing a clear framework. Should we start from the brain computational primitives and figure out how to apply them to real-world problems (bottom-up approach), or should we build on working AI solutions and fine-tune them to increase their biological plausibility (top-down approach)? In this talk, we will see why biological plausibility and hardware efficiency are often two sides of the same coin, and how neuroscience- and AI-driven insights can cross-feed each other toward low-cost on-device training.

Speaker's Bio:
Charlotte Frenkel is an Assistant Professor at Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands. She received her Ph.D. from Universit√© Catholique de Louvain in 2020 and was a post-doctoral researcher at the Institute of Neuroinformatics, UZH, and ETH Z√ºrich, Switzerland. Her research aims at bridging the bottom-up (bio-inspired) and top-down (engineering-driven) design approaches toward neuromorphic intelligence, with a focus on digital neuromorphic processor design, embedded machine learning, and brain-inspired on-device learning.
Dr. Frenkel received a best paper award at the IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS) 2020 conference, and her Ph.D. thesis was awarded the FNRS / Nokia Bell Scientific Award 2021 and the FNRS / IBM Innovation Award 2021.

The event also featured the Pre-Innerve Games Prize Distribution, acknowledging winners of pre-hackathon challenges, and the Innerve 9.0 Prize Distribution, where the top five teams were felicitated by the Chairman and Director.

A particularly inspiring segment of the evening was the presentation by the winning teams, allowing them to showcase their pioneering ideas and the impact of their work. This was followed by a special Token of Appreciation ceremony, where the contributions of judges and evaluators were recognized by the Chairman. The event culminated in a thought-provoking address by the Chairman, where he emphasized the significance of innovation, perseverance, and collaborative problem-solving in shaping the future of technology. The evening concluded with a heartfelt Vote of Thanks by the Director, a group photograph capturing the spirit of Innerve 9.0, and an engaging high tea and networking session, fostering meaningful discussions among participants, faculty, and industry experts.

Subject: Celebrating the Grand Success of Innerve 9 Hackathon 
 
Greetings from the OSS Club.

It is with great pride and enthusiasm that we reflect on the resounding success of Innerve 9.0, a platform where innovation, teamwork, and technical brilliance converged to create groundbreaking solutions. Over the span of two days (07 - 08 Feb 2025), 31 participating teams engaged in solving hardware, software, and sponsored problem statements, demonstrating exceptional creativity, technical expertise, and a commitment to real-world problem-solving.

At the heart of this competition were some of the most promising young innovators, and we are delighted to announce the top-performing teams:

The First-Place Winners, Team Luminosity from Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering, Bengaluru, showcased an outstanding project that stood out for its technical sophistication and impact, winning a prize money of Rs 1,25,000/-. The Second Place was secured by Team PAWS from MIT Academy of Engineering, Pune winning a prize money of Rs 75,000/-, followed closely by Team StarkTech Mavericks from GH Raisoni College of Engineering and Management, Pune, who claimed the third position and received a prize money of Rs 50,000/-.

Additionally, Team AMINUTEMAN from Dr DY Patil Institute of Engineering Management and Research, Pune, was recognized with the Ingenious Award for their exceptional problem-solving approach, while Team Thursday from Army Institute of Technology, Pune, was honoured with the Visionary Award for their forward-thinking innovation.

This year, Innerve 9.0, a fully student-driven initiative, was meticulously planned and executed by the Open-Source Software team, reflecting the immense dedication and organizational excellence of our students. The seamless execution of the event was made possible through the unwavering efforts of the OSS Club Secretaries, @3327 KAUSHAL <mailto:kaushalvyas_22100@aitpune.edu.in>  and @2313 DEEPSHIKHA RAWAT <mailto:deepshikharawat_22924@aitpune.edu.in> , whose leadership and coordination ensured a remarkable experience for participants, judges, and industry representatives alike. Their dedication, along with the entire OSS team, transformed Innerve 9.0 into a platform of excellence and innovation.

Subject: Celebrating the Grand Success of Innerve 9 Hackathon 
 
Greetings from the OSS Club.

It is with great pride and enthusiasm that we reflect on the resounding success of Innerve 9.0, a platform where innovation, teamwork, and technical brilliance converged to create groundbreaking solutions. Over the span of two days (07 - 08 Feb 2025), 31 participating teams engaged in solving hardware, software, and sponsored problem statements, demonstrating exceptional creativity, technical expertise, and a commitment to real-world problem-solving.

At the heart of this competition were some of the most promising young innovators, and we are delighted to announce the top-performing teams:

The First-Place Winners, Team Luminosity from Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering, Bengaluru, showcased an outstanding project that stood out for its technical sophistication and impact, winning a prize money of Rs 1,25,000/-. The Second Place was secured by Team PAWS from MIT Academy of Engineering, Pune winning a prize money of Rs 75,000/-, followed closely by Team StarkTech Mavericks from GH Raisoni College of Engineering and Management, Pune, who claimed the third position and received a prize money of Rs 50,000/-.

Additionally, Team AMINUTEMAN from Dr DY Patil Institute of Engineering Management and Research, Pune, was recognized with the Ingenious Award for their exceptional problem-solving approach, while Team Thursday from Army Institute of Technology, Pune, was honoured with the Visionary Award for their forward-thinking innovation.

This year, Innerve 9.0, a fully student-driven initiative, was meticulously planned and executed by the Open-Source Software team, reflecting the immense dedication and organizational excellence of our students. The seamless execution of the event was made possible through the unwavering efforts of the OSS Club Secretaries, @3327 KAUSHAL <mailto:kaushalvyas_22100@aitpune.edu.in>  and @2313 DEEPSHIKHA RAWAT <mailto:deepshikharawat_22924@aitpune.edu.in> , whose leadership and coordination ensured a remarkable experience for participants, judges, and industry representatives alike.

Subject: Celebrating the Grand Success of Innerve 9 Hackathon 
 
Greetings from the OSS Club.

It is with great pride and enthusiasm that we reflect on the resounding success of Innerve 9.0, a platform where innovation, teamwork, and technical brilliance converged to create groundbreaking solutions. Over the span of two days (07 - 08 Feb 2025), 31 participating teams engaged in solving hardware, software, and sponsored problem statements, demonstrating exceptional creativity, technical expertise, and a commitment to real-world problem-solving.

At the heart of this competition were some of the most promising young innovators, and we are delighted to announce the top-performing teams:

The First-Place Winners, Team Luminosity from Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering, Bengaluru, showcased an outstanding project that stood out for its technical sophistication and impact, winning a prize money of Rs 1,25,000/-. The Second Place was secured by Team PAWS from MIT Academy of Engineering, Pune winning a prize money of Rs 75,000/-, followed closely by Team StarkTech Mavericks from GH Raisoni College of Engineering and Management, Pune, who claimed the third position and received a prize money of Rs 50,000/-.

Additionally, Team AMINUTEMAN from Dr DY Patil Institute of Engineering Management and Research, Pune, was recognized with the Ingenious Award for their exceptional problem-solving approach, while Team Thursday from Army Institute of Technology, Pune, was honoured with the Visionary Award for their forward-thinking innovation.

This year, Innerve 9.0, a fully student-driven initiative, was meticulously planned and executed by the Open-Source Software team, reflecting the immense dedication and organizational excellence of our students. The seamless execution of the event was made possible through the unwavering efforts of the OSS Club Secretaries, @3327 KAUSHAL <mailto:kaushalvyas_22100@aitpune.edu.in>  and @2313 DEEPSHIKHA RAWAT <mailto:deepshikharawat_22924@aitpune.edu.in> , whose leadership and coordination ensured a remarkable experience for participants, judges, and industry representatives alike. Their dedication, along with the entire OSS team, transformed Innerve 9.0 into a platform of excellence and innovation.

The event also featured the Pre-Innerve Games Prize Distribution, acknowledging winners of pre-hackathon challenges, and the Innerve 9.0 Prize Distribution, where the top five teams were felicitated by the Chairman and Director.

A particularly inspiring segment of the evening was the presentation by the winning teams, allowing them to showcase their pioneering ideas and the impact of their work. This was followed by a special Token of Appreciation ceremony, where the contributions of judges and evaluators were recognized by the Chairman. The event culminated in a thought-provoking address by the Chairman, where he emphasized the significance of innovation, perseverance, and collaborative problem-solving in shaping the future of technology. The evening concluded with a heartfelt Vote of Thanks by the Director, a group photograph capturing the spirit of Innerve 9.0, and an engaging high tea and networking session, fostering meaningful discussions among participants, faculty, and industry experts.

There was significant media coverage of the event in the form of Pre-Press Releases and Post-Press Releases. Innerve was featured in more than 15 News Channels across Pune.

Dear Students,
It has been noticed that many of you are not attending Mathematics-3 lectures and tutorials regularly. This is a serious issue, as attending classes is very important to understand the subject and score well in exams.
Please note:

1.	Attendance is compulsory for both lectures and tutorials as per institute rules.
2.	Students who remain absent will face strict action, which may affect internal marks and eligibility for exams.
3.	Tutorials are held to help you practice and clear your doubts. Missing them will affect your performance in the subject.

I strongly advise all students to attend all lectures and tutorials without fail from now on. Those who continue to remain absent will be reported to the Head of Department, and strict action will be taken.
Let us all work together for a successful semester.
Best regards,
[Mr. Sachin Gaikwad]

Title: Trustworthy Generative AI

Speaker Name: Prof. Lav Varshney

Speaker Organization: University Illinois Urbana-Champaign

Date & Time: Tuesday| 14th January| 11:00 AM

Venue: Room No. KR225; 2nd Floor, KReSIT Building; Dept. of CSE

Abstract: Generative AI has taken the world by storm and is impacting numerous application areas ranging from music and art to engineering design and scientific discovery.  In this talk, we will first present several examples of generative AI technology and deployment, such as knowledge-based approaches going back to Chef Watson and statistical approaches including large language models.  Then we discuss desiderata and public policy around generative AI, including recent efforts in industry and the U.S. federal government.  Finally, we will detail a new approach to generative AI called information lattice learning that reifies many of the desiderata and policy objectives, achieving state-of-the-art performance in knowledge discovery, semantic compression, visual classification, and creativity/generation, while being very data-efficient, compute-efficient, human-controllable, and IP liability free.

Speaker Bio: Lav Varshney is an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, co-founder and CEO of Kocree, Inc., a startup company using novel human-integrated artificial intelligence (AI) in social music co-creativity platforms to enhance human wellbeing across society, and chief scientist of Ensaras, Inc., a startup company focused on AI and wastewater treatment.  He also holds affiliations with RAND Corporation and with Brookhaven National Laboratory.  He is a former White House staffer in the U.S. government, having recently served on the National Security Council staff as a White House Fellow, where he contributed to national and international AI and wireless communications policy.  Previously at IBM Research, he led the development and deployment of the Chef Watson system for culinary creativity as the first commercially successful generative AI technology, which also received worldwide acclaim.  At Salesforce Research, he was part of the team that open-weight released the largest and most capable large language model at the time.  His work and public scholarship has been featured in media ranging from Fox News and the Wall Street Journal to the New York Times, national public radio, Slate, and The New Yorker.  He appeared in the Robert Downey, Jr. documentary series, Age of AI.  He holds a B.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Cornell University and S.M. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  His current research interests include information theory; artificial intelligence foundations, explainability, and governance; agent-based policymaking; creativity and innovation; and AI applications in health and wellbeing.

Look forward to your presence.

Best,
IITB Trust Lab Team

Dear All,

We are pleased to invite you to an in-person talk by Mr. Rishabh Ranjan, PhD student in the CryptoSec and Theory groups at the University of California, San Diego, as part of IITB Trust Lab‚Äôs Colloquium Series.

Here are the details:

Title: The Concrete Security of Two-Party Computation
Speaker Name: Mr. Rishabh Ranjan
Speaker Organization: University of California, San Diego
Date & Time: Tuesday | 7th January 2025 | 4:00 PM
Venue: Room No. KR225; 2nd Floor, KReSIT Building; Dept. of CSE
Remote Participation Link: https://us06web.zoom.us/j/83979504989?pwd=IbpoBzzcK1tTGzvg7BPtfjdz2Y2Xba.1 <https://us06web.zoom.us/j/83979504989?pwd=IbpoBzzcK1tTGzvg7BPtfjdz2Y2Xba.1> 
Passcode: 219903

Abstract: This paper initiates a concrete-security treatment of two-party secure computation. The first step is to propose, as target, a simple, indistinguishability-based definition that we call InI. This could be considered a poor choice if it were weaker than standard simulation-based definitions, but it is not; we show that for functionalities satisfying a condition called invertibility, that we define and show is met by functionalities of practical interest like PSI and its variants, the two definitions are equivalent. Based on this, we move forward to study the concrete security of a canonical OPRF-based construction of PSI, giving a tight proof of InI security of the constructed PSI protocol based on the security of the OPRF. This leads us to the concrete security of OPRFs, where we show how different DH-style assumptions on the underlying group yield proofs of different degrees of tightness, including some that are tight, for the well-known and efficient 2H-DH OPRF, and thus for the corresponding DH PSI protocol. We then give a new PSI protocol, called salted-DH PSI, that is as efficient as DH-PSI, yet enjoys tighter proofs.

Speaker Bio: Mr. Rishabh Ranjan <https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~riranjan> is a PhD student at the University of California, San Diego, with research interests in provable security and cryptography. He has previously worked as a software engineer at Microsoft and holds a Bachelor‚Äôs degree from BIT Mesra, Ranchi.

Look forward to your presence.

Subject: Re: Tips for the Final year Batch of AIT , Pune 
 
Hi Manoj Sir,

Here are some tips for the final year batch:

1. Master the Fundamentals

*	Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA): This is non-negotiable. You need a solid grasp of arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, dynamic programming, etc.

	*	Resources: ""Cracking the Coding Interview"" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces

*	Operating Systems (OS): Understand processes, threads, memory management, deadlocks, and scheduling.
*	Computer Networks: TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS, sockets, and network security are crucial.
*	Database Management Systems (DBMS): SQL queries, database design, and normalization are important.
*	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Master concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

2. Build Strong Coding Skills

*	Practice, Practice, Practice: Solve coding problems regularly on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codewars. Focus on optimizing your code for time and space complexity.
*	Choose a Language: Become proficient in at least one language like Python, Java, or C++.
*	Understand Your Code: Don't just memorize solutions. Understand the underlying logic and be able to explain your approach clearly.

3. System Design Preparation

*	Learn the Basics: Understand how to design scalable systems. Familiarize yourself with concepts like load balancing, caching, databases, and APIs.
*	Practice Design Problems: Work on system design questions like ""Design a URL shortening service"" or ""Design Twitter.""
*	Resources: ""Designing Data-Intensive Applications"" by Martin Kleppmann, system design resources on YouTube and online platforms.

4. Projects and Portfolio

*	Personal Projects: Build something! Having personal projects demonstrates your initiative and ability to apply your skills.
*	Internships: Real-world experience is highly valued. Try to secure internships at tech companies or research labs.
*	GitHub: Showcase your code and projects on GitHub.

5. Company-Specific Research

*	Know the Company: Research the company's products, services, culture, and values.
*	Tailor Your Answers: Connect your skills and experiences to the company's needs.

6. Mock Interviews

*	Practice with Friends: Conduct mock interviews with friends or family to get comfortable with the interview format.
*	Online Platforms: Use platforms like Pramp or InterviewBit to practice with other engineers.

Important Tips:

*	Stay Updated: Keep up with the latest technology trends.
*	Communication is Key: Clearly explain your thought process and solutions during interviews.
*	Ask Questions: Asking thoughtful questions shows your interest and engagement.
*	Don't Give Up: Rejection is a part of the process. Learn from your mistakes and keep improving.

Subject: [Trust Lab Connect] Colloquium | Separating Broadcast from Cheater Identification | 21st November, 2024 
 
Dear All,

As a part of the IITB Trust Lab colloquium series, we will be hosting an 
in-person talk by Mr. Yashvanth Kondi, Principal Scientist at Silence 
Laboratories on Thursday, 21st November 2024, from 4 PM onwards.

Here are the details:

Title: Separating Broadcast from Cheater Identification

Date & Time: Thursday| November 21| 4 PM onwards |In-person

Venue: CC 109

For those who cannot join in-person, here is the remote participation link:

https://us06web.zoom.us/j/84033440808?pwd=ZHuaVsbE6FSCk2e72owYJDDYOj1zjH.1
Meeting ID:  840 3344 0808
Passcode: 711665

Abstract: Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) protocols that achieve 
Identifiable Abort (IA) guarantee honest parties that in the event that they 
are denied output, they will be notified of the identity of at least one 
corrupt party responsible for the abort. Cheater identification provides 
recourse in the event of a protocol failure, and in some cases can even be 
desired over Guaranteed Output Delivery. However, protocols in the literature 
typically make use of broadcast as a necessary tool in identifying cheaters. 
In many deployments, the broadcast channel itself may be the most expensive 
component. In this work, we investigate if it is inherent that MPC with IA 
should bear the full complexity of broadcast. As the implication of broadcast 
from IA has been established in previous work, we relax our target to 
circumvent this connection: we allow honest parties to differ in which 
cheaters they identify, nonetheless retaining the ability to prove claims of 
cheating to an auditor. We show that in the honest majority setting, our 
notion of Provable Identifiable Selective Abort (PISA) can be achieved 
without a traditional broadcast channel.

Indeed, broadcast in this setting‚Äîwhich we term Broadcast with Selective 
Identifiable Abort (BC-IA)‚Äîis achievable in only two point-to-point rounds 
with a simple echoing technique. On the negative side, we also prove that 
BC-IA is impossible to achieve in the dishonest majority setting. As a 
general result, we show that any MPC protocol that achieves IA with r 
broadcasts, can be compiled to one that achieves PISA with 2(r+1) point to 
point rounds. As a practical application of this methodology, we design, 
implement, and benchmark a six-round honest majority threshold ECDSA protocol 
that achieves PISA, and can be deployed in any environment with point to 
point communication alone.

Bio: Mr. Yashvanth is currently a Principal Scientist at Silence 
Laboratories, where he conducts research on cryptographic protocols and 
Multiparty Computation (MPC) in particular. His interests include threshold 
signatures, zero-knowledge proofs, and problems that emerge as MPC matures as 
a technology. Prior to this, he earned his PhD from Northeastern University 
in Boston, and spent a year as a PostDoc at Aarhus University.
We look forward to your presence.

 Please note the following points w.r.t. subject line:

1.	
	It was informed to all the students before proceeding to Diwali holidays that CG file checking and Index sign will be there during 11 November to 13 November 2024.
2.	
	It is not a short notice intimation.
3.	
	No students should write an email to me requesting the CG file checking by your roommate or friend.
4.	
	I need the respective student physically present while checking CG files. I can not tell corrections to your fiend or roommate.
5.	
	Such type of file checking never ever happens in computer department.
6.	
	You should understand the importance of academics.
7.	
	Make sure that you have submitted all the assignments, Mini-Project and Question Papers on MS Team of Cg subject, before coming for file checking (personally).
8.	
	If the submitted code of CG assignments found to be similar, all the students code will be rejected.
9.	
	Only submitting video of the CG mini-project is not sufficient, every team has to come and explain the work done related to CG Mini-project.

Dear Student:
Effective feedback is designed to determine a learner's level of understanding and skill development to plan the next steps towards achieving the learning intentions or goals.

*	Kindly keep the following points in Mind before Completing All the Feedbacks...

1.	Anonymity: Your course evaluations are completely anonymous, both the numerical results and written comments. Your responses are not linked to your ID number. Note that this is why each evaluation must be completed in one sitting.
2.	Confidentiality: The complete results are confidential to the instructor, HoD, Principal and Director.
3.	Be respectful: Derogatory comments or criticisms based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc. are not appropriate in course evaluations.
4.	The instructor cannot see the results until the final grades for the course have been submitted and processed.
5.	When you are providing feedback, you will be comparing the instructor to other instructors, either consciously or unconsciously. When you are comparing, remember that the comparison group should be other professors and courses at the Institute, not teachers and courses at high school.

*	Considerations when Writing Comments

1.	Constructive feedback from students is a valuable resource for improving teaching. The feedback should be specific, focused, and respectful. It should also address aspects of the course and teaching that are positive as well as those which need improvement.
2.	Be specific and provide examples when commenting on the course or the instructor. Speak based on your own experiences, not on behalf of your classmates.
3.	Focus on observable behaviors of the instructor or on specific aspects of the course. Describe the situation you are commenting on.

The Feedback is on ERP(https://erp.aitpune.edu.in:8006/), Login and go to forms‚Üí Academic Feedback‚Üí select Academic Feedback 2024-25 SEM I End-SEM.

Dear Student:
Effective feedback is designed to determine a learner's level of understanding and skill development to plan the next steps towards achieving the learning intentions or goals.

*	Kindly keep the following points in Mind before Completing All the Feedbacks...

1.	Anonymity: Your course evaluations are completely anonymous, both the numerical results and written comments. Your responses are not linked to your ID number. Note that this is why each evaluation must be completed in one sitting.
2.	Confidentiality: The complete results are confidential to the instructor, HoD, Principal and Director.
3.	Be respectful: Derogatory comments or criticisms based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, etc. are not appropriate in course evaluations.
4.	The instructor cannot see the results until the final grades for the course have been submitted and processed.
5.	When you are providing feedback, you will be comparing the instructor to other instructors, either consciously or unconsciously. When you are comparing, remember that the comparison group should be other professors and courses at the Institute, not teachers and courses at high school.

*	Considerations when Writing Comments

1.	Constructive feedback from students is a valuable resource for improving teaching. The feedback should be specific, focused, and respectful. It should also address aspects of the course and teaching that are positive as well as those which need improvement.
2.	Be specific and provide examples when commenting on the course or the instructor. Speak based on your own experiences, not on behalf of your classmates.
3.	Focus on observable behaviors of the instructor or on specific aspects of the course. Describe the situation you are commenting on.

The Feedback is on ERP(https://erp.aitpune.edu.in:8006/), Login and go to forms‚Üí Academic Feedback‚Üí select Academic Feedback 2024-25 SEM I End-SEM.

It was observed that for the last 2 weeks, very few students were attending classes & practical sessions. Such practices will lead to actions being taken against such students, like detention of the semester or, may be, a negative attendance system will be carried out, which will affect your both academic and Hostel allocation for next year.

Following are some of the default students whose attendance is below 65%:
